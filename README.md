Design Project II Application Development

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to
build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying
to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.

- Rich Cook

Description:
This application is an object oriented design of the first project. We have a database (PostgreSQL) to keep up with an inventory of ATVs. ATVs can be checked in and out, and the program handles all of the transactions/data collection. The new feature to this program is the time records. Time stamps are created upon check out and check in. The time functions in PostgreSQL allow us to calculate the amount of time an ATV is checked out. This opens a wide variety of data collection over the course of this mythological ATV rental business.
